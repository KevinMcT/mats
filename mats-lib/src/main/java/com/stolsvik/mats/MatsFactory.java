/**
 * The start point for all interaction with MATS - you need to get hold of an instance of this interface to be able to
 * code MATS endpoints. This is an implementation specific feature (you might want a JMS-specific {@link MatsFactory},
 * backed by a ActiveMQ-specific JMS ConnectionFactory).
 * <p>
 * It is worth realizing that all of the methods {@link #staged(String, Class, Class, Consumer) staged(...config)};
 * {@link #single(String, Class, Class, ProcessSingleLambda) single(...)} and
 * {@link #single(String, Class, Class, Consumer, Consumer, ProcessSingleLambda) single(...configs)};
 * {@link #terminator(String, Class, Class, ProcessTerminatorLambda) terminator(...)} and
 * {@link #terminator(String, Class, Class, Consumer, Consumer, ProcessTerminatorLambda) terminator(...configs)} are
 * just convenience methods to the one {@link #staged(String, Class, Class) staged(...)}. They could just as well have
 * resided in a utility-class. They are included in the API since these relatively few methods seem to cover most
 * scenarios. <i>(Exception to this are the two
 * {@link #subscriptionTerminator(String, Class, Class, ProcessTerminatorLambda) subscriptionTerminator(...)} and
 * {@link #subscriptionTerminator(String, Class, Class, Consumer, Consumer, ProcessTerminatorLambda)
 * subscriptionTerminator(...Consumers)}, as they have different semantics, read the JavaDoc).</i>
