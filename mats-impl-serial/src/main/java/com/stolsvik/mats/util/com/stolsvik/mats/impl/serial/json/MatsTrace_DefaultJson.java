/**
 * (Concrete class) Represents the protocol that the MATS endpoints (their stages) communicate with. This class is
 * serialized into a JSON structure that constitute the entire protocol (along with the additional byte arrays
 * ("binaries") and strings that can be added to the payload - but these latter elements are an implementation specific
 * feature).
 * <p>
 * The MatsTrace is designed to contain all previous {@link CallImpl}s in a processing, thus helping the debugging for any
 * particular stage immensely: All earlier calls with data and stack frames for this processing is kept in the trace,
 * thus enabling immediate understanding of what lead up to the particular situation.
 * <p>
 * However, for any particular invocation (invoke, request or reply), only the current (last) {@link CallImpl} - along with
 * the stack frames for the same and lower stack depths than the current call - is needed to execute the stage. This
 * makes it possible to use a condensed variant of MatsTrace that only includes the single current {@link CallImpl}, along
 * with the relevant stack frames.
 * <p>
 * One envisions that for development and the production stabilization phase of the system, the default long form is
 * used, while when the system have performed flawless for a while, one can change it to use the condensed form, thereby
 * shaving some cycles for the serialization and deserialization, but more importantly potentially quite a bit of
 * bandwidth and message processing compared to transfer of the full trace.
 * <p>
 * Serialization and deserialization is left to the implementations, but Jackson JSON databind library is recommended.
