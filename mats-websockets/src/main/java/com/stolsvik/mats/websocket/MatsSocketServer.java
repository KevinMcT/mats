/**
 * The MatsSocket Java library, along with its several clients libraries, is a WebSocket-"extension" of the Mats library
 * <i>(there are currently clients for JavaScript (web and Node.js) and Dart (Dart and Flutter))</i>. It provides for
 * asynchronous communications between a Client and a MatsSocketServer using WebSockets, which again asynchronously
 * interfaces with the Mats API. The result is a simple programming model on the client, providing Mats's asynchronous
 * and guaranteed delivery aspects all the way from the client, to the server, and back, and indeed the other way
 * ("push", including requests from Server to Client). It is a clearly demarcated solution in that it only utilizes the
 * API of the Mats library and the API of the <i>JSR 356 WebSocket API for Java</i> (with some optional hooks that
 * typically will be implemented using the Servlet API, but any HTTP server implementation can be employed).
 * MatsSocketEndpoints are simple to define, code and reason about, simple to authenticate and authorize, and the
 * interface with Mats is very simple, yet flexible.
 * <p/>
 * Features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Very lightweight transport protocol, which is human readable and understandable, with little overhead
 * ({@link MessageType all message types} and {@link MatsSocketCloseCodes all socket closure modes}).</li>
 * <li>A TraceId is created on the Client, sent with the client call, through the MatsSocketServer, all the way through
 * all Mats stages, back to the Reply - logged along all the steps.</li>
 * <li>Provides "Send" and "Request" features both Client-to-Server and Server-to-Client.</li>
 * <li>Reconnection in face of broken connections is handled by the Client library, with full feedback solution to the
 * end user via event listeners</li>
 * <li>Guaranteed delivery both ways, also in face of reconnects at any point, employing an "outbox" and "inbox" on both
 * sides, with a three-way handshake protocol for each "information bearing message": Message, acknowledge of message,
 * acknowledge of acknowledge.</li>
 * <li>Client side Event Listener for ConnectionEvents (e.g. connecting, waiting, session_established, lost_connection),
 * for display to end user.</li>
 * <li>Client side Event Listener for SessionClosedEvents, which is when the system does not manage to keep the
 * guarantees in face of adverse situation on the server side (typically lost database connection in a bad spot).</li>
 * <li>Pipelining of messages, which is automatic (i.e. delay of 2 ms after last message enqueued before the pipeline is
 * sent) - but with optional "flush()" command to send a pipeline right away.</li>
 * <li>Several debugging features in the protocol (full round-trip TraceId, comprehensive logging, and
 * {@link DebugOption DebugOptions})</li>
 * <li>Built-in and simple statistics gathering on the client.</li>
 * <li>Simple and straight-forward, yet comprehensive and mandatory, authentication model employing a
 * MatsSocketServer-wide server {@link AuthenticationPlugin} paired with a Client authentication callback, and a
 * per-MatsSocketEndpoint, per-message {@link IncomingAuthorizationAndAdapter IncomingAuthorizationAndAdapter}.</li>
 * <li>The WebSocket protocol itself has built-in "per-message" compression.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>There is no way to cancel or otherwise control individual messages: The library's simple "send" and
 * Promise-yielding "request" operations (with optional "receivedCallback" for the client) is the only way to talk with
 * the library. When those methods returns, the operation is queued, and will be transferred to the other side ASAP.
 * This works like magic for short and medium messages, but does not constitute a fantastic solution for large payloads
 * over bad networks (as typically <i>can</i> be the case with Web apps and mobile apps).</li>
 * <li>MatsSockets does not provide "channel multiplexing", meaning that one message (or pipeline of messages) will have
 * to be fully transferred before the next one is. This means that if you decide to send over a 200 MB PDF using the
 * MatsSocket instance over a 2G cellular network, any concurrent messages will experience a massive delay. This again
 * means that you should probably not do that: Either you should do such a download or upload using ordinary HTTP
 * solutions, or employ a second MatsSocket instance for this if you just cannot get enough of the MatsSocket API - but
 * you will get more control over e.g. cancellation of the transfer with the HTTP approach.</li>
 * </ul>
