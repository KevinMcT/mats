/**
 * Implementation of {@link JmsMatsTransactionManager} handling only JMS (getting Connections, and creating Sessions),
 * doing all transactional handling "native", i.e. using only the JMS API (as opposed to e.g. using Spring and its
 * transaction managers).
 * <p>
 * This {@link JmsMatsTransactionManager} (currently) creates a new JMS Connection per invocation to
 * {@link #getTransactionContext(JmsMatsStage)}, implying that each {@link JmsMatsStage} and each
 * {@link JmsMatsInitiator} gets its own JMS Connection, while each {@link JmsMatsStageProcessor} of a stage shares the
 * stage's JMS Connection (due to it invoking {@link TransactionalContext_JmsOnly#getTransactionalJmsSession(boolean)}).
