/**
 * Implementation of {@link JmsMatsTransactionManager} that in addition to the JMS transaction also handles a JDBC SQL
 * {@link Connection} (using only pure java, i.e. no Spring) for which it keeps transaction demarcation along with the
 * JMS transaction, by means of <i>"Best Effort 1 Phase Commit"</i>:
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>JMS transaction is entered</b> (a transactional JMS Connection is always within a transaction)
 * <li>JMS Message is retrieved.
 * <li><b>SQL transaction is entered</b>
 * <li>Code is executed, including SQL statements.
 * <li><b>SQL transaction is committed - <font color="red">Any errors also rollbacks the JMS Transaction, so that none
 * of them have happened.</font></b>
 * <li><b>JMS transaction is committed.</b>
 * </ol>
 * Out of that order, one can see that if SQL transaction becomes committed, and then the JMS transaction fails, this
 * will be a pretty bad situation. However, of those two transactions, the SQL transaction is absolutely most likely to
 * fail, as this is where you can have business logic failures, concurrency problems (e.g. MS SQL's "Deadlock Victim"),
 * integrity constraints failing etc - that is, failures in both logic and timing. On the other hand, the JMS
 * transaction (which effectively boils down to <i>"yes, I received this message"</i>) is much harder to fail, where the
 * only situation where it can fail is due to infrastructure/hardware failures (exploding server / full disk on Message
 * Broker). This is called "Best Effort 1PC", and is nicely explained in <a href=
 * "http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077963/open-source-tools/distributed-transactions-in-spring--with-and-without-xa.html?page=2">
 * this article</a>. If this failure occurs, it will be caught and logged on ERROR level (by
 * {@link JmsMatsTransactionManager_JmsOnly}) - and then the Message Broker will probably try to redeliver the message.
 * Also read the <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/should-i-use-xa.html">Should I use XA Transactions</a> from Apache
 * Active MQ.
 * <p>
 * Wise tip when working with <i>Message Oriented Middleware</i>: Code idempotent! Handle double-deliveries!
 * <p>
 * The transactionally demarcated SQL Connection can be retrieved from the {@link MatsTxSqlConnection} utility class.
 * <p>
 * It requires a {@link JdbcConnectionSupplier} upon construction. The {@link JdbcConnectionSupplier} will be asked for
 * a SQL Connection in any MatsStage's StageProcessor that requires it: The fetching of the SQL Connection is lazy in
 * that it won't be retrieved (nor entered into transaction with), until it is actually requested by the user code by
 * means of {@link MatsTxSqlConnection#getConnection()}.
 * <p>
 * The SQL Connection will be {@link Connection#close() closed} after each stage processing (after each transaction,
 * either committed or rollbacked) - if it was requested during the user code.
 * <p>
 * This implementation will not perform any Connection reuse (caching/pooling). It is up to the supplier to implement
 * any pooling, or make use of a pooled DataSource, if so desired. (Which definitely should be desired, due to the heavy
 * use of <i>"get new - use - commit/rollback - close"</i>.)
