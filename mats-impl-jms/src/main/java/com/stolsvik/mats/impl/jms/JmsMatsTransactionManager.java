     * For reference: In the JCA spec, it is specified that one JMS Connection is used per one JMS Session (and in the
     * JMS spec v2.0, this is "formalized" in that in the "simplified JMS API" one have a new class JMSContext, which
     * combines a Connection and Session in one). This will here mean that for each {@link JmsMatsTxContextKey}, there
     * shall be a unique JMS Connection (i.e. each StageProcessor has its own Connection). It does makes some sense,
     * though, that JMS Connections at least are shared for all StageProcessors for a Stage - or even for all
     * StageProcessors for all Stages of an Endpoint. However, sharing one Connection for the entire application (i.e.
     * for all endpoints in the JVM) might be a bit too heavy burden for a single JMS Connection.
