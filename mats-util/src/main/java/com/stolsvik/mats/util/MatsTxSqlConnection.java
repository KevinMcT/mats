/**
 * The different MATS Transaction Managers that include and handle a SQL {@link Connection} will provide some means for
 * {@link MatsStage} Stage Processors to get hold of the transactional Connection by using the static method
 * {@link #getConnection()}. This is done by the MATS Transaction Manager binding a SQL Connection Supplier to a
 * ThreadLocal by invoking the {@link #setThreadLocalConnectionSupplier(Supplier)}.
 * <p>
 * Notice that within a Spring environment, the usual way to get hold of the SQL Connection is by means of an injected
 * {@link DataSource} which the Spring transaction system has taken control of, so that the Connection you get out of
 * that DataSource is the transactional Connection for that thread. There is however no similar logic outside of such a
 * IoC Container, so this is class is made to be a portable way for a MATS Stage Processor to get a SQL Connection: It
 * shall work both outside the IoC container ("pure java"), and within the IoC container (DataSource proxying by the
 * Spring Transaction Manager in conjunction with the IoC system).
