/**
 * Defines the operations needed by MATS to serialize and deserialize both objects and {@link MatsTrace}s to and from
 * Strings (e.g. JSON or XML) - this can be employed separate from the communications mechanism (e.g. both the JMS and
 * RabbitMQ implementation can utilize the same serializer).
 * <p>
 * The default implementation is {@link MatsDefaultJsonSerializer}, employing Jackson JSON library to serialize to JSON.
 * <p>
 * It is worth pointing out that <i>all</i> the communicating parties needs to be using the same serialization
 * mechanism, as this constitute the "wire-representation" of the protocol that {@link MatsTrace} represents.
 * <p>
 * One can envision the protocol being serialized in a binary fashion, getting much smaller wire representations.
